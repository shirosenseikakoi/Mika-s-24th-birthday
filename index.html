            Happy Blessed Birthday, my best friend! You're already 24. I know life can be really tough sometimes, but remember, 
            nothing lasts forever. You have the strength to overcome them, so keep your head up. If you ever need someone to talk to, someone you can cry on, you know that I'm 
            always here for you. I'm just one call away. I pray for you every day, for your health, happiness and so on. 
            Do you know that I'm so proud of who you've become—a strong, independent, kind, intelligent and reliable person.
        </p>
        <p></p>

            I've heard from a friend na masarap daw magmahal ang mga teachers. Awee, sanaol! HAHAHA. So stay who 
            you are, and I pray that someone will keep and care for your heart the way you love them. I pray for your 
            success and one day your goals will be achieved. I'm right here supporting you. Hwaiting!
        </p>
        <p>You can now blow your candle!</p>
    
        <p>改めて、お誕生日おめでとう、ミカちゃん...すき</p>
